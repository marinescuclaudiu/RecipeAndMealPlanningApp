## MVP

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
- Implementing CRUD for users.
- The registration will accept user details like name, email, and password, and store them securely.
- The login will authenticate users based on their credentials.

### 2. Recipe Management and Browsing
- Implementing CRUD for recipes.
- This feature includes the ability to view detailed recipes, including ingredients, nutritional facts, preparation time, cooking instructions, etc.
- User may search for recipes based on preferences (e.g. vegan, gluten-free etc).

### 3. Meal Planning Tool
- Implementing CRUD for meal plans.
- Each meal plan is linked to specific recipes from the recipe management API. If user doesn't find a recipe that suits him, he may create one before.
- The API should allow users to specify the time frame for the meal plan (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- For each meal period (breakfast, lunch, dinner) he must specify between 1-3 recipes.

### 4. Shopping List Creator
- Implementing CRUD for shopping list.
- Generate and manage shopping lists based on meal plans or selected recipes.

### 5. Personalized Nutritional Tracker
